BUSINESS PROCESS MODEL TRANSLATOR (BPMT) --- README
---------------------------------------------------

Note: Since the BPMT is based on the Moses Translation System,
the primary development platform for Moses is Linux,
and this is the recommended platform since you will find it easier to get support for it.
For other platforms, have a look at 'http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Development.GetStarted'.

Please make sure that the files 'bin/translations/moses' and 'bin/translations/runMosesTranslation.sh'
are executable.

The entrance point to the BPMT is the config file (config.properties) of the current directory.
In this file you can specify several options for the translation process. Those options are
described at the top of the file.

After having specified all the values, you can execute the main class ('src/main/Main.java', 'bin/main/Main.class').

Basically, there are two ways of how to use the BPMT:

On the one hand, you can choose to translate a .tsv file of annotated labels.
(see config.properties for information about the content of this file.)
This .tsv file is specified as the value of the key 'annotatedLabels'
and contains the labels that will be translated.
There is another similar key called 'annotatedLabelsContext'.
Normally, this key will have the same value as 'annotatedLabels'.
However, if the .tsv file of 'annotatedLabels' was extracted from a larger .tsv file
that contains much more labels, you can specify this larger .tsv file as the value
of 'annotatedLabelsContext'. The labels of this file will not be translated but used
as context information for the translation of the labels of 'annotatedLabels'.
For example, the directory 'resources/testData/SignavioAI' contains the files 'SignavioAI_Every10thRow.tsv'
and 'SignavioAI.tsv'. 'SignavioAI_Every10thRow.tsv' contains every 10th row of 'SignavioAI.tsv'.
If you specify 'SignavioAI_Every10thRow.tsv' as the value of 'annotatedLabels' and 'SignavioAI.tsv'
as the value of 'annotatedLabelsContext', every 10th row of the the SignavioAI will be translated but 
all the other labels will be used as context information.
If you don't want to include this additional context information, just specify 'SignavioAI_Every10thRow.tsv'
as the value of 'annotatedLabelsContext'.

On the other hand, you can specify the PromniCAT database ID of an .svg representation
of a process model together with the path to a PromniCAT database config file.
This model will be translated and a new revision (.svg representation only) of the translated 
model will be saved in the specified database stored in the same directory as the original model.
Note that also in this case you should specify values for 'annotatedLabels' and 'annotatedLabelsContext' because
the information in this files is used during the translation process.
If you don't have annotations for the labels of the model, the Stanford Tagger is used to annotate them.
For example, if you specified the 'SignavioAI.tsv' file, the translator will try to find annotations of the labels of
the model specified by the database ID in this file. If it doesn't find any, it will use the Stanford Tagger.

The key 'outputDirectory' is used to specify the directory in which information about the translation results are stored.
It will contain a list of translations of the two translators (Moses, BPMT), BLEU hypotheses and a Statistics file.
The Statistics file tells you how many times BPMT and Moses chose the same translations. Moreover, it lists the translations
that differ between Moses and BPMT.
